                    Advaya is a vibrant event organized by the Sigma Association
                    to welcome second-year students into the Artificial
                    Intelligence and Machine Learning Department. It fosters a
                    supportive environment, embracing students as valued
                    community members. The event marks the start of their
                    academic journey, building connections and camaraderie that
                    will guide them through their three-year adventure.
